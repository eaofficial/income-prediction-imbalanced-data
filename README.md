# income-prediction-imbalanced-data
In this project, I used imbalanced data to predict if the income is below or above 50000. Imbalanced data usually make the model biased so I used various Undersampling and oversampling techniques to coutnter it. One major algorithm used is SMOTE. And machine leargning algorithm used is naive-bias.
